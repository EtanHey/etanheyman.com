# System Patterns: etanheyman.com

## Architecture Overview

etanheyman.com follows the Next.js App Router architecture pattern with React components, utilizing modern React patterns and practices.

## Component Patterns

- **Layout Components**: Define the structure and shared UI elements across pages
- **Page Components**: Contain route-specific content and logic
- **UI Components**: Reusable UI elements that make up the interface
- **Custom Animation Components**: Home-grown solutions for interactive elements like the timeline arrow

## Styling Approach

- TailwindCSS v4 for utility-first CSS
- Custom theme variables defined in globals.css
- Dark/light mode support through CSS variables and media queries
- Responsive design using Tailwind's breakpoint system
- No inline styles - all styling through Tailwind utility classes

## State Management

- React's built-in hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext) for local state management
- Next.js data fetching patterns for any server-side data needs

## Navigation

- Next.js App Router for file-based routing
- Custom navigation components for enhanced user experience
- Mobile-optimized navigation for smaller screens

## Animation Strategy

- Custom scroll-based animations using requestAnimationFrame for performance
- CSS transitions for smooth UI state changes
- Vanilla JavaScript for position calculations and element transformations
- Minimalist approach with subtle animations that enhance UX without being distracting
- Exploring the potential of CSS Scroll-Driven Animations:
  - `animation-timeline: scroll()` for scroll-progress-based animations
  - `animation-timeline: view()` for element visibility animations
  - Consideration of browser support limitations (Chrome/Firefox support, Safari pending)

## Performance Considerations

- Component code splitting for optimized loading
- Image optimization through Next.js
- Minimizing client-side JavaScript
- Efficient rendering with React best practices
- Using requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Debouncing scroll and resize events
- Preferring CSS-only solutions when possible
- Running animations off the main thread where supported

## Accessibility Patterns

- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast compliance
- Screen reader compatibility
- Progressive enhancement ensuring core functionality works without animations

## Testing Strategy

- Component testing with appropriate testing library
- Accessibility testing
- Responsive design testing across devices
- Cross-browser testing for animation fallbacks
