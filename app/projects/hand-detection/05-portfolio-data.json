overview": {
    "description": "A sophisticated computer vision pipeline that detects and classifies hands in real-time using YOLO architecture. The model distinguishes between hands, arms, and background with 96% accuracy, making it suitable for gesture recognition applications, accessibility tools, and human-computer interaction systems.",
    "problem": "Accurate hand detection is crucial for gesture recognition systems, but existing solutions often struggle with distinguishing hands from arms and handling diverse lighting conditions.",
    "solution": "Built a custom YOLO-based model trained on 1,740 manually annotated images with strategic data collection across diverse conditions."
