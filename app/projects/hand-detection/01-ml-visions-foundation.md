# Complete workflow (tested end-to-end)
# 1. Dataset upload (1-2 minutes for 600 images)
scp -r -P [PORT] -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 hand_cls root@[IP]:/workspace/

# 2. Training (10 seconds on RTX A5000)
yolo classify train model=yolov8n-cls.pt data=/workspace/hand_cls epochs=15 batch=32 device=0

# 3. Model download (<1 second for 3MB model)
scp -P [PORT] root@[IP]:/workspace/runs/classify/train/weights/best.pt ./
```

**Infrastructure Optimizations**:
- SSH key management with passphrase support
- Automated script generation for training
- Git LFS integration for model versioning
- Cost optimization (RTX A5000 @ $0.25/hour)

## Dataset Structure & Statistics

**Final Dataset Composition**:
```
hand_cls/
├── train/
│   ├── hand/        # 463 images
│   └── not_hand/    # 230 images
└── val/
    ├── hand/        # 117 images
    └── not_hand/    # 59 images

Total: 867 images
Training: 693 images (80%)
Validation: 176 images (20%)
Class ratio: ~2:1 (hand:not_hand)
```

**Data Quality Innovations**:
- **Consistent lighting**: Video capture ensures uniform conditions
- **Natural variations**: Multiple recording sessions with different poses
- **Append mode**: Incremental dataset improvement without loss
- **Quality naming**: `hand_001.jpg`, `hand_002.jpg` etc.

**Frame Extraction Sophistication**:
```python
# extract_frames_to_dataset.py
def distribute_frames(temp_dir, class_name, train_dir, val_dir, total_frames=100, append=False):
    """Distribute frames 80/20 between train and val."""
    # Intelligent file numbering for append mode
    # Maintains sequence across training sessions
    # Prevents filename conflicts
```

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Classification vs Detection Choice
**Decision**: Use YOLOv8 classify (not detect)
**Rationale**:
- Binary classification simpler than bounding box detection
- Faster inference (26+ FPS vs slower detection)
- Smaller models (3MB vs larger detection models)
- Perfect for presence/absence determination

### 2. Video-Based Data Collection
**Decision**: Replace manual photo collection with automated video capture
**Impact**:
- 600 images in 2 minutes vs hours of manual collection
- Consistent lighting and camera settings
- Natural temporal variation within recordings
- Scalable data augmentation through multiple sessions

### 3. Cloud Training Strategy
**Decision**: Local development + RunPod training
**Benefits**:
- Local dataset preparation and testing
- Cloud GPU for fast training (10 seconds vs minutes locally)
- Cost-effective ($0.25/hour for RTX A5000)
- Reproducible training environment

### 4. Model Versioning System
**Decision**: Implement comprehensive version control
**Features**:
- Automatic version numbering
- Training lineage tracking
- Metadata preservation (epochs, dataset size, timestamps)
- Incremental improvement workflow

## Problems Encountered & Solutions

### 1. Command Line Sensitivity
**Problem**: YOLO commands spanning multiple lines ignored parameters
**Solution**: Enforce single-line commands in all documentation
```bash
# WRONG (parameters ignored)
yolo classify train \
    model=yolov8n-cls.pt \
    data=/workspace/hand_cls \
    epochs=15

# CORRECT (all parameters processed)
yolo classify train model=yolov8n-cls.pt data=/workspace/hand_cls epochs=15 batch=32 device=0
```

### 2. SSH Connection Complexity
**Problem**: RunPod SSH proxy connections unreliable
**Solution**: Direct IP connections with proper key management
```bash
# Simplified SSH key creation
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "workshop" -N "runpod"

# Direct connection pattern
ssh [pod-id]@ssh.runpod.io -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

### 3. Dataset Upload Optimization
**Problem**: 600+ images = slow uploads
**Solution**: Multiple upload strategies
- Traditional: Upload extracted images (400MB, 10-15 min)
- Fast: Upload videos only (40MB, 1-2 min) + cloud extraction

### 4. Python Environment Conflicts
**Problem**: Multiple Python versions (3.12.8 vs 3.11.6 with pyenv)
**Finding**: System worked despite version mismatch
**Solution**: Document environment but prioritize functionality

### 5. Over-Engineering Risk
**Problem**: Attempted script consolidation broke working video capture
**Resolution**: Reverted to modular architecture
**Learning**: "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" - modular design was optimal

## Code Patterns & Architecture

### 1. Modular Script Design
```python
# capture_and_prepare.py - Orchestrator
def main():
    # Check existing dataset
    # Run capture_dataset_videos.py
    # Run extract_frames_to_dataset.py
    # Provide next steps

# capture_dataset_videos.py - Single responsibility
def record_video():
    # Handle video recording only

# extract_frames_to_dataset.py - Single responsibility
def extract_frames():
    # Handle frame extraction only
```

**Benefits**:
- Easy debugging of individual components
- Reusable scripts for different workflows
- Clear separation of concerns
- Proven reliability through testing

### 2. User Experience Patterns
```python
# Real-time feedback during recording
def draw_text(frame, text, position=(50, 50)):
    """Draw text with dark background for visibility."""
    # Background rectangle for readability
    # Consistent font and sizing
    # Color-coded feedback

# Progress indication
def countdown_capture(cap, duration=3, video_type="hands"):
    """Show preparation and countdown before recording."""
    # 2-second preparation message
    # 3-second countdown
    # Clear visual indicators
```

### 3. Error Handling & Recovery
```python
# Robust file operations
def count_existing_images(directory):
    """Count existing images in directory."""
    if not os.path.exists(directory):
        return 0
    # Handle missing directories gracefully

# User choice handling
if existing_images:
    print("1. Replace existing images (start fresh)")
    print("2. Add to existing images (append)")
    print("3. Cancel")
    # Clear options with safe defaults
```
