# CoachGolem

> Life planning — daily schedule, calendar integration, ecosystem status, and gentle nudging.

## What It Does

CoachGolem is the **life planner**: it reads state from all other golems, integrates with Google Calendar, and helps plan the day. It does NOT invoke other golems — it reads their status and helps the human prioritize.

## Design Principles

1. **Read-only** — CoachGolem reads other golems' state, never invokes them
2. **Human-centric** — suggests priorities, doesn't auto-execute
3. **Calendar-aware** — knows about meetings, deadlines, blocked time
4. **Health-aware** — integrates with Whoop for recovery/strain/sleep data
5. **Gentle** — nudges, doesn't nag. Respects energy levels and context
6. **Graceful degradation** — works without Calendar or Whoop credentials

## How It Works

```
Morning:
  1. Read all golem statuses (jobs found, outreach pending, drafts ready)
  2. Read Google Calendar (meetings, deadlines)
  3. Read Whoop data (recovery score, strain, sleep performance)
  4. Generate daily plan with priority-sorted pending items
  5. Send to Telegram as morning nudge (via briefing)

Evening:
  1. Check compliance: what got done vs. plan
  2. Weekly summary tracks completion rate over 7 days
```

## Key Types

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `DailyPlan` | Date, greeting, time blocks, pending items, summary |
| `TimeBlock` | Start/end, type (meeting/focus/break), title, source |
| `EcosystemStatus` | Timestamp, all golem statuses, healthy/unhealthy count |
| `PendingWorkItem` | Item description, priority, originating golem |

## Telegram Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/plan` | Today's schedule + pending tasks |
| `/golems` | All golem ecosystem statuses |

## Wiring

- **Briefing** (`@golems/services`) imports `generateDailyPlan` and `formatPlanForTelegram` from Coach
- **Calendar** reuses Gmail OAuth2 credentials
- **Compliance tracking** stored in `~/.golems-zikaron/coach/compliance.json` (90-day retention)

## Dependencies

- `@golems/shared` — GolemStatus type, telegram-direct, state-store
- `@golems/jobs` — getStatus() for job match counts
- `@golems/recruiter` — getStatus() for draft/follow-up counts
- `@golems/teller` — getStatus() for financial summary
- `googleapis` — Google Calendar API v3
- Whoop API — recovery, sleep, strain metrics
